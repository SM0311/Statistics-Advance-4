It represents the range of values within which the true population parameter is expected to lie, with a certain level of confidence. It is calculated by multiplying the critical value for the desired level of confidence by the standard error of the sample mean.\n",

    "The margin of error is affected by several factors, including the level of confidence, sample size, and variability in the data. A larger sample size generally results in a smaller margin of error because it reduces the standard error of the sample mean. This is because as the sample size increases, the variability of the sample mean decreases and the sample mean becomes a better estimate of the population mean. This reduction in variability leads to a more precise estimate of the population parameter, which results in a smaller margin of error.\n",
